# Resnet50-Pre-Trained-Model-for-cifar10-prediction
In this project I used a pre-trained resnet50 model and added modifications that allows me to use it to do cifar10 image classification. The modifications inlcude using average global pooling, adding data augmentation, and adding new fully connected layers. With this approach, I achieved a 95.73% accuracy on the cifar10 image classification task
